<h1>MACHINE LEARNING</h1>MACHINE LEARNING<br>
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to perform tasks without explicit programming. The core idea behind machine learning is to allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

Key Concepts in Machine Learning:

Training Data: Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data to learn patterns and make predictions. This data is used during the training phase to teach the model how to perform a specific task.

Features and Labels: In supervised learning, a type of machine learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. The features are the input variables, and the labels are the corresponding desired outputs. The model learns to map features to labels.

Algorithms: Various machine learning algorithms are used based on the type of task. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Training and Testing Phases: The dataset is typically divided into a training set and a testing set. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the testing set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning:

Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data, and it learns to make predictions or classifications.
Unsupervised Learning: The model is provided with unlabeled data and must find patterns or relationships within the data.
Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
Feature Engineering: The process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from the raw data to improve the performance of the machine learning model.

Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

Overfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well but fails to generalize to new data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting the hyperparameters (configurable settings) of a machine learning model to optimize its performance.
So what defines our students, faculty and community members? Above all, its our belief in the infinite possibilitie and our unshakable optimism. Its a connection to others near and far. A hunger for socio-economic transformation that pushes us to tackle challenges and pursue progress. Its the conviction that together we can create a world of good. Join us on the journey.
